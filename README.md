# WH40k Point Tracker

This is a small web-app used to monitor Primary and Secondary objectives (as well as CP) in the 9th edition of Warhammer 40k.

It was based off the incredibly [useful scoresheet](https://www.goonhammer.com/ruleshammer-mistakes-were-made-in-my-first-game-of-9th/) produced by Goonhammer
